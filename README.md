# Markdown Editor Extension

A Markdown editor that will allow for adding classes, ids, styles, and divs to
the page. This will facilitate typing basic blog posts without needing to type
HTML by hand, along with not needing WYSIWYG editors, while still displaying
the results. The ultimate goal is to have a parser that can be used in the editor,
on a Node backend, and in React, while having an easily digestible format that
will allow it to be moved to other languages.
